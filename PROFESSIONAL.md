## Work Philosophy

I find myself most comfortable working with a small but motivated team, building a service for other engineers.

In my opinion, [dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) a product seems the most suitable means of developing software.

I take pride in my work and want to build something we can all be proud of. **Each contribution is carefully reviewed and tested.** I prefer the assurance of code safety and reliability over scrappy shipping (unless the need is absolutely dire). Systems built with such attention to detail are easier to grok, maintain, and share workload.


## Known Weaknesses

> I sometimes tend to shell up and keep to myself when encountering anxiety or a difficult problem.

How I address this:
- create a Slack channel for any project I am leading or working on where I post regular updates, wins, challenges, metrics
- for smaller tasks, I timebox my research efforts to no longer than a few hours and reach out to other team members if I feel stuck
