Known Weaknesses

> I sometimes tend to shell up and keep to myself when encountering anxiety or a difficult problem.

How I address this:
- create a Slack channel for any project I am leading or working on where I post regular updates, wins, challenges, metrics
- for smaller tasks, I timebox my research efforts to no longer than a few hours and reach out to other team members if I feel stuck
