LaunchDarkly
------------

Hey! I've been a fan of LaunchDarkly since having used it extensively when I used to work for Percy.io! I have recently been in communication with Julia Burton about a fullstack role. Hoping there is still an opening as I am most definitely interested.

I am a product engineer primarily focused on developing web applications. I lean more toward the backend and API development. The majority of my recent professional experience has been with Ruby/Rails, but personal projects in Python or NodeJS. I am a San Francisco resident and US Citizen. I prefer to work remotely with the option to come into or travel to an office occasionally.

Spittinâ€™ Corporate Game
===

I find myself most comfortable working with a small but motivated team of engineers and designers to build a platform for other engineers.

The majority of my recent professional experience has been with Ruby/Rails, but personal projects in Python or NodeJS. I am a San Francisco resident and US Citizen. I prefer to work remotely with the option to come into or travel to an office occasionally.

I feel my skillset and what I am looking for in my next role align with what Science is seeking in the job description:

- I have been developing web applications with Ruby + Rails for over 5 years now and absolutely love its expressiveness!
- I desire strong sense of ownership and independence over a large product surface area.
- I work best on a small, close-knit team that fosters a positive, healthy work environment.

Additionally, I very much distrust "the cloud"! It's what's got me into self-hosting, regular backups, and owning my own data ;-)

Career Pitches

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”

6 September 2020

I am a software engineer who has the most experience doing Java backend development but is interested in switching over to frontend and full stack development. Most of the work I had done art Sonder wads on the feont wend with Ruby on Rails and React components. One in fact even had React, Redux, Sagas

Although I am interested in doing more development on the frontend,  I am most interested in product engineering and working with a client to develop a product.



I define myself as a Product Engineer and Full Stack Software Developer.

I thoroughly enjoy working with clients to identify pain points and ways to improve their workflow while simultaneously building the solution to their hurdles.

While my interest lies in the advancement of web technologies and the open web, most of my professional experience has been backend-oriented at the API level

Some old stuff from forever ago


AncestryDNA

Hi!  I'm Josh Lindsay and am a software engineer in San Francisco.  I have a wide range of experience from startups to large corporations.  I specialize in Java backend development, particularly at the API level.  I have a few Python side-projects that involve website crawling and data aggregation.

Admittedly, I became interested in DNA studies from the 23andMe and AncestryDNA Amazon Prime Day kits.  I find the analysis comprehensive and results absolutely fascinating!  I am curious what technical challenges are offered in the space and how my expertise can help tackle some of them.

Siri Team Recruiter

Another question: Are there other opportunities available within Siri?  I am particularly interested in Natural Language Understanding and Computational Linguistics roles.

Having studied linguistics academically and a number of languages (Slavic and Romance) both academically and leisurely, I have long held a fascination with the abstraction of language.

It is my understanding that Siri currently supports 21 languages and is now at a place where it could benefit from more widespread language support.  I am confident my skill set and experience can effectively contribute to that goal.

I recall having an engaging interview with one of the engineers on the NL team about universal language structure.

IFTTT Hiring Manager

My 4+ years of professional software development experience lie primarily in Java backend services and API development.  My most recent role at LendUp was building a microservice comprised of multiple APIs to manage financial transaction history and statement generation and publishing.

I do have a few projects I am working on (particularly utilizing headless Firefox to more easily handle network requests and session management), but Iâ€™ve not open sourced them as they could possibly breach terms of service for the respective games ðŸ˜‡

I believe I can provide immense value to IFTTT being a user of the service myself and wanting to see deeper, more consistent integration with services.  I value the flexibility and power services provide through means of APIs.  IFTTT partnering with a number of companies to solve the problem of creating tentative workarounds to completing tasks It gives a sense of owning oneâ€™s data in this technological world plagued by walled gardens.


I apply for this Full Stack position because have always held a fascination for client-side work.  I have a rudimentary understanding from building simple, backend-heavy web applications at my time at HotPads and on my website (https://j000sh.com).
