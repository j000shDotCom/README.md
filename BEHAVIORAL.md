About Me
========

Time working with a difficult team member?

Working directly with the Percy cofounder. He was very personable, but was known across the team to have a "my way or no way" attitude.

Since there were only three of us as dedicated backend/API engineers (including him), we spent a lot of time working together.



Projects

Azure DevOps Integration
- github, bitbucket, gitlab, slack
- When trying to give a feature demo to Microsoft, I allowed Perfect to be the enemy of good
    - there were a list of essential features
        - update commit and pull request statuses during and after a build
        -

Data Deletion Service

This was the most challenging project of my career that spanned almost an entire year while I worked at Percy.

Challenges:
- Hitting MySQL database read/write lock wait timeouts
- Determine recent-use of deduplicated objects (images, resources, assets). like a massive, ongoing LRU cache

Percy Enterprise

Challenges:
- Main team member leaving the company after we ironed out product specifications



Questions for interviewer

- How are OKRs determined? Do product managers request updates from engineers/eng management before drafting?
- I am curious about company culture with regard to engineering. For instance, are there hackathons or other events tailored to eng growth? I am excited to see there is a Gusto Engineering blog detailing some successes and challenges (https://engineering.gusto.com)
-
- on the day-to-day, how would you estimate the dev time vs planning/team meeting ratio?
- are there opportunities for mentorship?
