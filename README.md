# Josh Lindsay ‚úäüèæ

I am a software engineer interested in the advancement of web technologies and the open web.

## Professional

- Senior full stack and product engineer
- Ruby on Rails, NodeJS, Python/Flask
- Backend-leaning, API development

## Ideal Work Environment

I find myself most comfortable working with a small but motivated team to build a platform for other engineers.

I take pride in my work and want to build something we can all be proud of!

I prefer to work remotely with an option to come into an office or coworking space occasionally.
