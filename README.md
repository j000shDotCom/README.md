# Josh Lindsay ‚úäüèæ

I am a software engineer interested in the advancement of web technologies and the open web.


## [Professional](PORTFOLIO.md)

- Senior full-stack product engineer
- **Ruby on Rails**, Python, NodeJS
- Backend-leaning web application and API development


## Work Philosophy

I find myself most comfortable working with a small but motivated team, building a service for other engineers.

In my opinion, [dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) a product seems the most suitable means of developing software.

I take pride in my work and want to build something we can all be proud of. **Each contribution is carefully reviewed and tested.** I prefer the assurance of code safety and reliability over scrappy shipping (unless the need is absolutely dire). Systems built with such attention to detail are easier to grok, maintain, and share workload.
